# AI-Driven Music Composition

## Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging deep learning techniques to generate music compositions in MIDI format. The core of this project lies in parsing a collection of MIDI files to extract musical elements such as notes and chords. Utilizing these elements, a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network is trained to understand the patterns and structures inherent in the music.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to delve into the creative capabilities of AI in the realm of music composition. It serves as a foundational exploration into generative music, providing a base for further research and development in this innovative field.

## How It Works
- **Data Processing**: The MIDI files are processed to extract the musical notes and chords.
- **Training the LSTM Model**: The LSTM neural network learns from these musical patterns.
- **Music Generation**: Once trained, the model can autonomously generate new music compositions based on the learned patterns.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow
- Music21
- Numpy
- MIDI processing libraries
